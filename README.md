## Requirements
- Docker
- VSCode

## Running
Download the Dev containers Extension. Set the Veracode Extension to run on a workspace in your `Open user Settings (JSON).
- After connecting to the Dev Container on VSCode using `Dev Containers: Open folder in Container`, you can download the Veracode extension and run the program normally. You have to reinstall the SCA IDE agent for this container.

## Working inside a container
VSCode has a good explanation of how this works, I recommend reading it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_quick-start-open-an-existing-folder-in-a-container).
